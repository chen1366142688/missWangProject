    <section>
        <h3>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</h3>
        <div class="desc">
            This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (herein referred to as the "Statement," "Terms," and/or "SRR", as the context may require), derives from the HandyLoan, and constitutes the terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with HandyLoan, as well as HandyLoan Technology Limited brands, products and services, which we call the “HandyLoan Services” or “Services”.

            By using or accessing the HandyLoan Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 13 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how HandyLoan works.

            Because HandyLoan provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service shall govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.

We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use HandyLoan to share with others and how we can collect and use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.

This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it;
            <p>
                ii)When you delete your IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others);
            </p>
            <p>
                iii)When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information, as well as content and information that others have shared with you. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information;
            </p>
            <p>
                iv)When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including responsible personnel of HandyLoan, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture); and
            </p>
            <p>
